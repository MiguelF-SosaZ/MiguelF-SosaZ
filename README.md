## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miguel Sosa. 

I am passionate about data and so I am constantly learning to become a **Data Scientist**. 
Some technologies I currently enjoy working with: Python, SQL Server, Power BI, Git (of course), and learning more every day.

Do you have any tips that will allow me to improve my projects? I would be very grateful.
